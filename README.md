# Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduler  

This repository contains an implementation of the **Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling Algorithm**, a CPU scheduling technique that dynamically moves processes between multiple priority queues based on their execution time. The project includes:  

- **Process scheduling simulation**  
- **Gantt chart visualization**  
- **Performance metrics calculation**  

## Features  

### Three-Level Queue System:  
- **Queue 1 (Highest Priority):** Shortest time quantum  
- **Queue 2 (Medium Priority):** Moderate time quantum  
- **Queue 3 (Lowest Priority):** Longest time quantum  

###  Dynamic Scheduling:  
- Processes start in **Queue 1** and move to lower-priority queues if they exceed their time quantum.  
- Short jobs get executed quickly, while long jobs are gradually pushed to lower queues.  

### ðŸ“Š Gantt Chart Visualization:  
- Displays a **clear execution timeline** for process scheduling.  

### ðŸ“ˆ Performance Metrics Calculation:  
- Computes **Turnaround Time (TAT)** and **Waiting Time (WT)** for all scheduled processes.  

## Technologies Used  
-  **Python**  
-  **Matplotlib** (for Gantt chart visualization)  
-  **Tabulate** (for structured output)  

## How It Works  
This program simulates **Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling**, where processes are dynamically assigned to different priority queues based on their execution time. Processes start in **Queue 1** and move to lower-priority queues if they exceed their time quantum, ensuring fair CPU allocation.  

## Advantages  
- **Efficient CPU Utilization** â€“ Short processes get executed quickly, while long processes are gradually scheduled.  
- **Dynamic Prioritization** â€“ Reduces response time for short tasks while preventing starvation for long tasks.  
- **Fair Process Handling** â€“ Ensures a balanced and adaptive approach to process scheduling.
